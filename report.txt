Development Environment:
    Operation system: macOS version 10.13.6 64 bits
    Memory: 8G
    gcc version: 5.4.0

Design of Implementation:

    PagedFileManager:
        1. Hidden Page: 
           
            - the hidden page is the first page which is created by the function     
              PagedFileManager::createFile and it not visible for user.

            - store the number of page into the first 4 byte as a unsigned int type.

     	    - store the records of  handle ID, number of read, write, append into hidden                                                                      
             page after the number of page when the function FileHandle::closeFile is             
             called. Each record contains 4 unsigned int number.
         
	2. File Handle ID:

	    - each handle ID is the attribute of Class FileHandle , and it is created by 
              PagedFileManager::openFile. 

        3.  Relationship between PagedFileManager and FileHandle

	    - FileHandle will get the name of the file created by PagedFileManager by the
              function FileHandle::setFileName.
    
    FileHandle:

	1. File* file
	   
	   - File* file is a file pointer which has the right to read and write the file 
             which is a attribute of FileHandle shared by every function.
